THIS IS VERY CRITICAL:
I NEED TO SORT OUT ISSUSING_AUTHORITY and ISSUING_AUTHORITY_REIGN CLASSES, including the _DL, _BL, and support classes.  

I needs to work like this:

-->  means "has a pointer in"
issuing_authority_name-->issuing_authority_reign-->issuing_authority

Okay, this is what is going to happen:

issuing_authority_reign contains issuing_authority
